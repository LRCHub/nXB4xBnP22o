If I could reach the stars
Pull one down for you
Shine it on the heart
So you could see the truth
That this love I have inside
Is everything it seems
But for now I find
It's only in my dreams
If I can change the world
I'll be the sunlight in your
universe
You would think my love
was really something good
Baby, if I could
change the world
If I could be king
Even for a day
I'd take you as my queen
I'd have it no other way
And our love will rule
In this Kingdom we have made
Till then I'd be a fool
Wishing for the day
If I can change the world
I'll be the sunlight in your
universe
You would think my love
was really something good
Baby, if I could
change the world
Baby, if I could
change the world
If I could change the world
I would be the sunlight
in your universe
You would think my love
was really something good
Baby, if I could
change the world
Baby, if I could
change the world
Baby, if I could
change the world
